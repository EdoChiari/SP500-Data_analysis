# Stock Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents a dashboard for analyzing the performance of a stock selected from the S&P 500. The dashboard is composed of three sections that provide insights into stock price trends, industry comparisons, and long-term performance.

## Dashboard Sections
1. **Stock Price Trend (Line Chart)**  
   Displays the historical price trend of the selected stock, allowing users to observe price changes over time.
   
2. **Industry Comparison (Bar Chart)**  
   Compares the one-year return of the selected stock with other companies in the same industry, helping assess its relative performance.
   
3. **Performance Overview (Bar Chart)**  
   Shows annualized returns over various time periods: 1 month, 1 quarter, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years. This section provides a comprehensive view of how the stock has performed across different investment horizons.

## Data
The dashboard pulls data from:
- **S&P 500 Company List**: Fetched from Wikipedia and cleaned for analysis.
- **Historical Stock Data**: Downloaded using the `quantmod` package, with a time range from 2010 to 2024.

## Instructions
1. **Fetch Data**: The project fetches the latest S&P 500 list from Wikipedia and retrieves historical stock data using `quantmod`.
2. **Data Processing**: Stock prices are cleaned and adjusted for easy comparison, including movements and long-term performance.
3. **Visualizations**: Three main visualizations are created:
   - A line chart for stock price trends.
   - A bar chart for industry comparison.
   - A performance chart for annualized returns over different periods.

## Usage
To use the dashboard:
1. Select a stock from the dropdown menu (pre-set to Amazon for demonstration).
2. View its time-trend, compare its performance with other industry players, and analyze its long-term returns.
